<b>Winter: Naive Prowess</b>

Pen & digital illustration published in the Applied Arts Magazine, 2013 Student Awards Edition and nominated top 10 for the AACE Award. Some more deets here: <a href="http://www.appliedartsmag.com/winners_gallery/archive/?id=1086&year=2013&clip=1" target="_blank">Applied Arts Magazine</a>

<i>"I virtually only ever paint and draw elephants. Naive Prowess is an exploration that meshed both design and illustration. It was a new way to utilize my drawings and incorporate my graphic design practice. The overall look and feel, and desire to expose various layers comes from my attraction to blatant brush strokes in painting. It seems more intimate and provides an additional perspective into how the piece was created."</i>

  Kraken International, headed by one of my main man hustlers, Mr. Seeley, its me up on the flip. Needs a face and a card. Black metal card, to be specific. Machine carved in pre brexit UK. Cray player.
</p>

The task at hand was to create an initial visual identity for Kraken International. Self described as a "proprietary turnkey technology [that] monitors and forecasts the world's financial markets, adaptively managing a highly efficient and optimized portfolio." E.i. the kraken turns cash into gold for any hedge fund. Plug and play, make it rain.

<b>Key Demographic</b><br>
Rich white males aged 40-50, heading successful hedge funds.

Kraken International had to be "professional, badass, elitist, matte black (sexy)". James Bond (Daniel Craig) turned out to be a great inspiration. He embodied this professional, expensive, badass, persona so well. And like any intimate game, it begins with a few key discovery conversation, note taking and getting the mood... board.

Wasn't the first time I created a moodboard, but it was the first time I'd referenced one so much (let alone more than once). It'd also been a long time since I'd designed a logo. This made me a nervous. Hitting up even more concepts than ever before (granted, still not enough). I'm well aware of my trend of seeking too shallow, too soon, and too quickly. More so, for this project, I made it a point to not really check my time, and not really consider the budget (too much). I wanted to make it about the product, and not some hourly metric. And if you're curious: I did go over the "ideal budget" for this one. But that's totally fine.

<b>Square Dimensions</b><br>
Kraken International will make appearances on both physical and digital mediums. For maximum versatility, and a greater sense of stability and icon-ism, I decided this logo should take square dimensional form. For contrast, previous explorations included more a more Nike "swooshy" look, but appeared too playful, weak, malleable. The "squished" look also hurt the tail's potential vertical rise. Old school emblems were also a source of inspiration, not necessarily drawing on their iconic symmetrical properties, but on that they can stand on their own as an insignia.

</div>

<b>The "Tail"</b><br>
The kraken form decidedly has 4 positive tentacles, visually creating another set of 4 negatives between these. Earlier concepts had equal positive and negative weights, however this created a much too heavy visual vibration, taking away from the entirety of form. To unify this, the negative weights were reduced, giving the "tail" a more solid appearance. A good counter balance to the "head".

The tail was to end in a rising graph (see immediate image below), to represent the key value of the Kraken International business: growth (and analytics). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number" target="_blank">Fibonacci sequence</a> was also explored to represent this compound, exponential growth. However this was later scrapped as it failed to compliment the entirety due to it's harsh variation in heights, and abrupt "unfinished" ends.

Fomo (fear of missing out) makes me run endless copies of each tiny iteration. More of an exploratory process, however. There's a balance to mess with. Clinging to the past can stifle the future. Truly, if an idea is worth while, it will persist and present itself both superior, and obvious. Sometimes it's good to let the past go. A method of moving forward into un-attached and unexplored creative alleys.

<b>The Eye</b><br>
Much consideration went into the eye, and whether or not there should be one at all. The decision to omit the eyes was greatly informed by my personal journeys in painting elephants. Eyes are quintessential receivers of interpretation (facial expressions), which make them an intense focal point. An elephant painting (or any figure, really) without eyes forces you observe the entire form, and wonder. An "eye-less" figure is mysterious, and unreadable. This was an aspect of the brand Adrian wanted to get across. Exclusivity has its roots in elitism, and exclusivity is a form or rarity. There is an inherit elusiveness to elements of elitism, from material goods to pop culture elite warriors who are deathly quiet, and deathly.. deadly. To put it more simply: it's comparable to the mysterious bad boy/girl, difficult to read, on his/her own level.

<b>Evolution</b><br>
The "4th" concept (image below) was actually the latter (5th). An appropriate step back in the process.

<b>Challenges</b><br>
Time constraint was a big challenge. The more I wanted to explore many more endless concepts, the more I also knew this had a tight deadline, and was still startup-level shit. With this limitation in mind, I was also aware of the intense depth needed to truly compliment and/or create a brand. Having said that, I'm well aware this is hardly "brand development".

<b>Takeaway</b><br>
Honest, my initial instinct was to send him the initial designs by email, with a note "let me know what you think", because I was too nervous he'd dislike it. Shame on me. Then, thinking back on my recent read <b>Design is a Job</b> by Mike Monteiro, Mike advocates you should never send out a proposal to a client without being in the room to sell it (or at least on a phone call). And that's what I did for the initial showing, and subsequent showings. And man, what a difference. I balls'd up, and spoke true to the concept and sold my work. It felt good, and the feedback was instant, and much more informative than interpreting an email response. Anyway.. I'd say that's my biggest takeaway here.

On top of that, simply exploring new ways of concept exploration, thinking outside the box as much as possible, with some added technical difficulties with Illustrator in producing a clean-vector logo.

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
This was a super fun side gig. Adrian is such a pleasure to work with. He's no stranger however. We met and worked together at Startup Weekend Ottawa 2014 (Startup: <b>Opt-In</b>). Shortly afterwards, I took part in designing an identity and website for <b>Fxture</b>, premium forex forecasting startup. Shortly after that, I'd moved to Montreal and join <b>Hive / Nu Messenger</b>, a startup co-founded by <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/adrianseeley" target="_blank">Adrian</a> and <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/jean-rené-carle-mossdorf-a1088213" target="_blank">Jean-René Carle</a>. Even crazier, he's the one who serendipitously introduced me to Hans, CEO of Nurx.

The person we are today is virtually the same person we were yesterday.<br>
The person we are today is quite different the person we was 5 years ago.<br>
The person we are today will be quite different than person we will be in 5 years.<br>
The difference can solely be perceived with time.

The work we put in today, for tomorrow, is tangible.<br>
The reward we receive for said work, today, for tomorrow, is intangible.<br>
Therefor the reward of today, for tomorrow, does not exist.<br>

    The work we put in today, for tomorrow, is pseudo-altruistic towards a future self.

For example, I am at a good place by virtue of the cumulative effort put in by my infinite past selves.
In honour of this&#151;analogous to buddhist reincarnation&#151;the least I should do is give back to my next self since I cannot give back to whom no longer exists. We are merely transitory in a scheme of personal evolution that is the perpetual becoming, disappearing of, and through, infinitesimal selves.

To not give back in this sense is both dishonourable and selfish.

This way of thinking enables us to realize and internalize the inherent intangibility of progress in the present state.
In other words: Itâ€™s okay that we receive nothing for the work we put in today.
Our reward is the surrounding environment of today and tomorrow.

is who will vanish today, and who will live tomorrow.

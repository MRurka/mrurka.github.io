The general premise of this idea on self progression is that change and reward must be perceived over time. Otherwise they can't exist.

<b>Change over time</b><br>
Who we are today is virtually the same person we were yesterday.<br>
Who we are today is considerably different than the person we were 5 years ago, or will be in 5 years time.<br>
This difference can solely be perceived with the passing of time.

<b>Reward over time</b><br>
The work we put in today, for tomorrow, is tangible.<br>
The reward we receive for said work, today, for tomorrow, is intangible.<br>
Therefor the reward of today, for tomorrow, does not practically exist.<br>

In this sense, the work we put in today, for tomorrow, is a sort of pseudo-altruistism towards our future selves, both infinitely ongoing – until we die of course – and infinitely numbered – given each moment of life.

<b>For Example</b><br>
I am at a good place by virtue of the cumulative effort put in by my infinite past selves.
In honour of this&#151;somewhat analogous to buddhist reincarnation&#151;the least I should do is give back to my next self since I cannot give back to whom no longer exists. We are merely transitory in a scheme of personal evolution that is the perpetual becoming, disappearing of, and through, infinitesimal selves.

And in a way, not giving back in this sense is selfish.

This way of thinking facilitates the realization and internalization of the inherent intangibility of progress in the present state.
In other words: It’s okay that we receive nothing for the work we put in today.
Because our reward is the surrounding environments of today and tomorrow.

Post tequila with our new Swiss friend, Daniel, Kolton yells "From Second Cup to San Francisco". In other words: "Started from the bottom now we're here". Two young and naive best friends from Fredericton, starting out. Onto chilling in San Francisco for both business and pleasure. We met 2 years ago in a Second Cup (Cafe) during a province-wide power outage. Fueled by <a href="https://vimeo.com/141549468" target="_blank">Jumpman</a>, late night <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">poms</a>, and our shared drive for progression, he's been my main bro since. Among my favourite memories with Kolton is helping him rock out a dashboard for a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/dragonsden/pitches/simptek-technologies" target="_blank">Dragon's Den appearance</a>. We designed and coded till the 9AM sunrise (from the night before).

In the great white tube 37,000 feet above ground, looking back thinking "I have no idea what I'm doing", wondering how I ever got here. It isn't unimaginable or even far reaching, but it is pretty damn cool, and I'm very thankful.

The 2 week séjour in SF was much like my time in Seoul. However this time, I worked. And worked damn well. As mentioned elsewhere, I worked with X company for about 6 months before finally meeting up with them. And my gosh, how cool it is. The office, the people. The close communication was a nice change from the usual shit-wifi-espresso-machine video calls.

In the heart of the Financial District, surrounded by a litany of strip clubs, I stayed at the Green Tortoise Hostel. Breakfast daily, events nightly. The hostel was &#151; for playful grace &#151; lit af. Beer Olympics couldn't have been more fun! Both internationals (via local hostels) and locals (via meetup groups) in attendance. Randomly got paired up with Ofo and we killed it. Losing only to Team Japan.

Went to a meetup hosted by "SF Critical Design and Speculative Futures". <a href="https://www.ideo.com/people/scott-paterson" target="_blank">Scott Patterson</a> from IDEO was the guest speaker. And predictably, it was no less than awesome! Felt fuzzy warm being surrounded by so many designers. Probably the result of the remote life. Gotta say though, I was baffled when no one raised their hands when asked "Who has been to our previous meetups?". Literally no one! In a room of 30-40 people! Mostly designers (if not all)! And to top it off: many people were on their phones during the talk. "マジかよ?, seriously".

As for "The City" (slogan for the San Francisco Warriors), San Francisco felt a lot smaller than anticipated. It's hardly dense, with not many tall buildings not sky scrapers. Found it comparable to Montreal in a few ways: A touch of Europe infused with in-city nature, but much larger with palm trees and a very visible poverty level.

I like it.

Let's go back?

Yeah, please.

What did you get out of it, really?

Aside from an intense fluctuation of anxiety, happiness, depression, and excitement; The friends I made was the best part. Irish, Switzerland, Ofo, Yuka, Mari, Chill UK Military bros, Pixar Girl, My Holland brothers, Belgium, Michel from Philly, The Singer Guy. Team Yager Bawls. My butt grabbed only twice in the Castro clubs. And dude, Japantown underground. So hush. So lit. So illegal.

Lest we forget,

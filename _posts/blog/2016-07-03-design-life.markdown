<b>Setting:</b> 34,500 feet above ground in the great metal bird, destined for the investor flex zone capital of the world. Said playfully, of course :)

Ian Lynam is a recent source of inspiration. I only really know him from his book "Parting It Out. Writings on Graphic Design" (thx <b>Kolton</b>). In the very least, this book makes me feel severely inadequate in the craft of graphic design, and design as a whole. <b>Fun fact:</b> Ian and I had a few email back-and-forths over a shipping complications, and got to briefly fanboy out on him a little. By the way, that damn (amazing) book <i>only</i> took 4 months to get to me >.>

Anyway, as I read on, each page is met with envy. <b>Ian Lynam</b> for his writing abilities, depth, and knowledge on culture, design, and design culture. Not to mention the many great designers he covers and/or mentions in his essays.

Fully realizing the envy, I remain unsure what to make of it. Sometimes I wonder if I want to be a great designer merely for the sake of being recognized and written about. As opposed to my popular recite: designing for the love of the craft, with a devotion to the appropriate, the beautiful and the functional.

It's a sobering consideration.

Perhaps I envy these individuals so much because I know nearly nothing about them. I only know of their bullet-point gamut of achievements. I don't know the WHY of their being. And admittedly, I rarely look into the why, and even the work itself (the reason they're influential anyway).

<b>Best guess:</b>

- I'm only talking the talk; Not walking the walk. And facing it kinda hurts my precious (pathetic) ego.

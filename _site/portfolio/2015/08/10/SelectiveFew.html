<p>Working with the Creative Director, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-peker/2a/539/779" target="_blank">Andrew Peker</a>, we produce various content that accurately reflect the brand, as well as the uncompromising quality of the products we sold. I also worked closely with the development team, working out the best possible user experiences within our start-up-driven limitations. Product Development Process was typically: Research, exploration and working with Creative Director to produce mock ups for the development team. Once the mockups were built and functional, they were be passed back to me for style touch ups (CSS) and final QA. At SF, I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conducted research in Ecommerce practicies, statistics, trends. Aiding design decisions.</li>
  <li>Designed website layouts, user experience and UI general elements.</li>
  <li>Created visual brand material</li>
  <li>Created marketting material for social media and Google Ads</li>
  <li>Coded large parts of the website styles (CSS) and often looked after the responsive CSS.</li>
  <li>Coded some parts of the HTML, if the development team needed an extra hand.  </li>
  <li>Polished the website elements and various parts as they were built, with CSS.</li>
</ul>
